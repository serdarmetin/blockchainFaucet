This is an initial implementation of an experimental blockchain faucet, managing multiple resource types in accordance with the Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) distribution scheme.

The original DRF algorithm calculates the shares over normalised demand vectors for each user, assuming that the normalised demand vector corresponds to a unit task. DRF iterates over the list of demand vectors and allocates one task to the least allocated user, and then reiterates with the updated allocation statuses, until at least one resource is exhausted.

The present algorithm differs from DRF for calculating the maximum allocatable dominant share with Max-min Fairness (MF) distribution scheme over the dominant share demands of users, and in turn, calculating the other shares for each user by conserving their relative ratio to the dominant share. In the MF distribution step, percantage demands are used and distributed against a hundred percent capacity. This is appropriate, since if every user has the same resource type as the dominant share, this type will go under an ordinary MF distribution, only over values converted to percentages in the process. Otherwise, since by definition the remaining resources are smaller in size with respect to the dominant share, their sum will not exceed hundred per cent. In the present implementation Autonomous Max-min Fairness (AMF) has been utilised as the MF subroutine.

The resulting distribution differs from DRF at least at two points. The first is that the resources are not allocated in real time as they are decided to be available for a given user, as it is in the original setting. The second is the fact that not all available resources are exhausted in a given distribution epoch. Both are in relation to the difference in setting, since DRF was developed for the real time distribution of computational resources for resource scheduling tasks in time sharing systems, and both may be tolerable in the blockchain setting, where the present algorithm is designed to handle the distribution of tokens for accessing generic resources, not in real time but in a token governed economy. Consequently, since the unexhausted resources are left to be distributed in consecutive epochs, the long time distribution may be expected to converge to the original DRF algorithm. This point may benefit from mathematical modeling and further scrutiny.

The correctness of the code and the and correspondence of the algorithm to DRF has not been cross-checked with simulation, and the gas cost performance tests has not been run on a sufficient variety of parameters yet.
